# Cisco CX
## Introduction
Following is a custom parser I used for a POC with a customer that had the (rather old) Cisco CX module on their ASA.  The CX module does send logs as a seperate syslog feed, so it's easy to split it apart from the ASA logs themselves.

While not absolutely complete, it did get the customer the particular logs they were interested in.
